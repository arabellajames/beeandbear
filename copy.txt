FIRST TRIP

Colorado - October 2014

Our recent trip to Summit County, Colorado, was amazing. The main purpose of the trip was to go and take a look at Copper Mountain and although it meant a seriously early start, it exceeded all expectations. It's awesome and the views from the summit are spectacular, extending all the way to Wingle Ridge located behind it. As an active ski resort, we were suprised to find the slopes deserted. The almost eerie silence made the experience all the more exciting. This picture was taken on an incredibly cold morning in early October. Mist had descended down from the mountain and covered the treetops. It's an incredible place.



SECOND TRIP

Reykjavik - August 2014

Iceland is one of our favourite places. This is our second time back here in a year and it's as beautiful as ever. This photo was taken on a whale watching trip; our base was the Old Harbour and we took a boat along the coast managing to catch site of five orcas in total. Seeing orcas in the wild is an incredibly special sight to behold. A whale watching tour is highly recommended, even if you're unlucky and don't get to see any, the scenery alone makes the whole trip worthwhile. Half way through the trip we stopped off and stood on a rocky shoreline. The dark stones contrasted beautifully with the freezing blue waters.
